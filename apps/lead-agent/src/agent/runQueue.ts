 * (which itself resumes coherently because every tool call it makes is
 * committed to SQLite immediately; see runAgentForLead).
 *
 * Idempotent locking: each lead is locked (leads.locked_at/locked_by) before
 * processing and released after, so if two workers race for the same lead,
 * only the one that wins tryAcquireLock proceeds -- the other skips it this
 * pass rather than double-processing. A lock older than the timeout is
 * treated as abandoned (crashed worker) and can be re-acquired by anyone.
