# Build log

A chronological decision log for this project: what was asked, what was decided, and why. Meant to
be skimmable by a teammate who wants the reasoning trail behind the codebase, not a chat export.
All entries below are from the same build session, 2026-07-20.

## Entry 1 — Domain selection

Asked to pick one domain from a shortlist (support triage, appointment scheduling, order returns,
restaurant reservations, recruitment screening, real estate lead follow-up) for an agentic-system
take-home. Chose real estate lead follow-up over the alternatives for three reasons: it's the
domain that actually maps to the hiring company's own product, rather than a generic example; it
carries genuine regulatory constraints (Fair Housing, contact-frequency norms) that produce an
authentic hard-prohibition guardrail instead of an invented one; and it doubles as something
actually usable afterward rather than a throwaway exercise. This decision shaped everything
downstream — the guardrails, the seed data, and the production-readiness discussion in the README
all trace back to real estate specifically having real compliance stakes.

## Entry 2 — Segment vs. stage modeling

Initially considered a single flat lead-status field, then redesigned into two orthogonal fields:
`segment` (`prospect`/`client`, flips exactly once and permanently when a deal reaches `won`) and
`stage` (funnel position, modeled as a graph, not a line, with a `dormant` side-branch and
re-entry rules). The reasoning: a flat status can't cleanly represent "existing client being
pitched an upgrade" without either a second parallel pipeline or special-casing every tool. With
`segment` and `stage` split apart, a cold prospect, a ghosted lead, a cancelled-then-returning
lead, and an existing client's upgrade pitch all live in exactly the same tools and the same stage
graph — `segment` just reshapes the drafting instructions handed to the model, never the control
flow.

## Entry 3 — Re-entry requires evidence, not agent discretion

Decided that `reactivate_lead(lead_id, evidence_interaction_id)` must require a real, recent
interaction row as evidence, rather than trusting the model's own judgment that "enough time has
passed" to re-approach a `dormant` or `canceled` lead. This became a state-machine-level guardrail
enforced inside the tool itself (checking the interaction's `lead_id`, `type`, and age against the
database), not a soft instruction in the prompt — the whole point is that the model's own reasoning
about timing can't be the thing standing between a lead and unwanted re-contact.

## Entry 4 — Contact boundary design (propose → approve → send)

The agent never contacts a lead directly. `propose_message` writes a `pending` row; a human
approves or rejects it via the CLI; only then can the agent call `send_message`, which
independently re-checks `proposal.status === 'approved'` inside the tool itself. The goal was to
keep the *entire* lifecycle — including the eventual send — as agent tool calls, so the model still
owns control flow end-to-end, while hard-gating the one action that actually reaches a real person
below the model's judgment. The system doesn't trust the model to "only send after it sees an
approval" conversationally; the tool enforces it regardless of what the model believes happened.

## Entry 5 — Property matching, scoped deliberately

`find_matching_properties` is plain structured SQL filtering on budget/location/type/bedrooms,
explicitly not RAG or embeddings — that was called out as out of scope in the brief and there was
no reason to reach for it anyway at this data size. It returns `insufficient_profile` explicitly
when a lead has none of budget/location/type on file, rather than guessing at a property to pitch.
That specific behavior became eval scenario 7: a minimal-profile lead should get a qualifying
discovery message, not a property pitch.

## Entry 6 — Numeric grounding principle

Decided early that `get_property_market_data` computes trend/price figures with plain deterministic
arithmetic — a percent change over the trailing data points and a linear-regression next-year
projection — and never via a model call, and that the agent may only *narrate* those numbers, never
originate its own. A fabricated number in a client-facing real estate message is a real liability,
not a cosmetic bug, so this was treated as a first-class design decision rather than an incidental
one. Went further and implemented it as an enforced guardrail on `propose_message` (the optional
stretch guardrail from the brief): any `$`/`%` figure in a draft must trace back to the most recent
market-data call for that lead, or the proposal is rejected with a typed error.

## Entry 7 — UI scope decision

The brief explicitly lists "UI polish" as out of scope. Considered building a plain web UI for the
submission anyway, decided against it — spending graded-property time on something explicitly
excluded had no upside. Built a formatted CLI instead (`chalk`/`cli-table3`: `dashboard`,
`proposals`, a readable `history`) — terminal formatting, not a UI layer — and deliberately budgeted
it at under an hour, built only after the seven graded properties (agent loop, guardrails,
resumability, human-in-the-loop, audit trail, evals, property matching) were solid.

## Entry 8 — Production-readiness review

After the initial build was complete, was asked directly: "is this production ready, is this how an
org would do it?" Answered honestly: no. Identified and prioritized the real gaps — compliance/
consent tracking as the biggest one (`do_not_contact` is a start, not audit-grade consent),
reliability (no retry/backoff on LLM calls, no protection against two workers processing the same
lead concurrently), observability (a domain audit trail exists via `audit_log`, but no ops-level
metrics — error rates, cost per run, human approval turnaround), and rollout strategy (a real org
ships draft-and-approve first and automates sending only after weeks of measuring approval rates,
not the full propose→approve→send flow at once, which is what this take-home necessarily
demonstrates in one submission).

## Entry 9 — Bug found in review, fixed with regression tests

While re-verifying the system live, the numeric-grounding guardrail false-positived on shorthand
like "$500k" — it was extracted and parsed as the literal number 500 (the "k" was silently
dropped), so it never matched any grounded figure and always got rejected, even though 500,000 is a
reasonable restatement of a number already grounded in that property's market data (it falls within
the guardrail's own tolerance of the projected next-year price). Fixed by normalizing k/K/m/M
shorthand and thousands-commas into a plain number before comparison (`parseMoneyToken`/
`parsePercentToken` in `src/domain/grounding.ts`), and added regression tests for the exact failing
case plus adjacent formats ("$1.2M", "1,200,000", "12%") plus an end-to-end test replaying the exact
draft sentence that originally triggered the bug, so this class of bug can't silently reappear.

## Entry 10 — Reliability/observability follow-up

Added the three other items identified in the production-readiness review, scoped to "prove the
mechanism, don't build the platform": exponential backoff with jitter on OpenAI 429/5xx responses
(3 retries, escalating gracefully with a clear logged reason instead of crashing once exhausted);
idempotent per-lead locking (`leads.locked_at`/`locked_by`, 5-minute abandonment timeout) so two
workers racing for the same lead only let one proceed; and a lightweight `run_metrics` table plus a
`metrics` CLI command (total runs, escalation rate, avg tool calls/run, estimated token cost,
average proposal-approval turnaround) as a first step toward real observability. All three were
verified with deterministic unit tests (`npm run test`, a stubbed OpenAI client, isolated in-memory
dbs) rather than live API calls, since the dev key's 50-request/day quota was already exhausted from
earlier live verification. See Entry 11 for what happened when the live eval suite was re-run
afterward.

## Entry 11 — Live eval re-run surfaced rate limiting, not a regression

Re-ran `npm run evals` live once the dev key's quota appeared to free up partway through the
session. First attempt: 2/7 scenarios failed with "expected awaiting_approval, got escalated" on
scenarios 1 and 3. Diagnosed by reproducing scenario 1 standalone with full audit-log output —
it succeeded cleanly on the first two reproductions, which ruled out a deterministic code bug and
pointed at rate-limit flakiness instead. A third reproduction confirmed it directly: the escalation
was `llm_call_failed` with the underlying error being a 429 on requests-per-minute (limit 10/min) —
i.e. the new retry/backoff feature correctly rode out what it could and gracefully escalated once
its retry budget was exhausted, exactly as designed. That's the reliability feature working, not a
defect in it.

Added pacing to the eval harness itself (an 8-second gap between scenarios, a more generous
retry budget for eval runs specifically) since this is a test-harness concern, not a change to
production defaults or domain logic. Re-ran the full suite again: 3/7 failed this time, worse than
before, with the same escalation signature starting on scenario 1 immediately. Root cause: the
diagnostic reproductions used to confirm the RPM theory themselves consumed a meaningful slice of
the day's 50-request cap, so the very quota needed for a clean full run was partly gone before the
paced attempt even started. Decided not to keep spending the remaining daily budget chasing a clean
run (each attempt burns quota that could complete a future clean one) and to document this
precisely instead: the seven scenarios' domain logic is unchanged and was fully verified live before
this upgrade round (see the original README section on what was verified live); this round's new
code (grounding fix, retry/backoff, locking, metrics) was verified deterministically via `npm run
test` (15/15 passing, no API key needed); and the only new *failure mode* introduced is that a
sufficiently rate-limited account can turn a would-be `awaiting_approval` into an `escalated` --
which is the intended graceful-degradation behavior, not silent corruption or a crash. A fresh
`npm run evals` run on a day with unused quota (or a higher-tier key) should reproduce the original
7/7 pass; this is flagged as a known limitation of verifying against a free-tier key rather than a
gap in the implementation.

## Entry 12 — Live progress display for `cli process`

Asked to show live progress while a run is in flight -- elapsed time, tokens used, current tool --
similar to how Claude Code's own CLI shows its status. Added an optional `onProgress` callback to
`runAgentForLead`, firing on every "thinking" (about to call OpenAI) and "tool_call" (a tool just
resolved) tick with the turn number, tool name, and cumulative token count. `processQueue` forwards
this per-lead. `cli/progress.ts` renders it as a spinner (elapsed time, tokens) that gets replaced
by a permanent checkmark line each time a tool call completes, ending in a final outcome line.
Purely additive -- the callback is optional everywhere, so nothing about evals/tests/resumability
changes when it isn't supplied. Verified with a deterministic test (a scripted fake OpenAI client
returning canned tool calls, no live API needed) confirming the exact event sequence and token
counts, plus a direct visual check of the renderer's raw terminal output.

## Entry 13 — Escalation parking was too coarse, plus request-efficiency pass

Using the new progress display surfaced a real usability gap: a lead that had escalated purely
because the LLM call itself failed (a 429 during earlier testing) was permanently excluded from the
queue -- `cli process 1` reported "queue is empty" even when explicitly naming the lead, because
`isParkedOnEscalation` treated every escalation identically, whether the model made a genuine
judgment call (contradictory signals, do-not-contact) or the agent loop's own safety net gave up
after an infrastructure hiccup. There was also no way to un-park a lead short of wiping the database.

Fixed both, plus a related efficiency ask (the dev account's 50-request/day cap): `escalate_to_agent`
gained an internal-only `system_triggered` flag on its Zod schema -- present in the tool's contract
but deliberately absent from the JSON schema exposed to the model in `openaiTools.ts`, so the model
has no way to set it. The three safety-net call sites in `loop.ts` (LLM call failed, no tool call
returned, turn budget exceeded) now pass `system_triggered: true`; `isParkedOnEscalation` only parks
on an escalation where that flag is absent, i.e. one the model itself chose to make. A rate-limited
lead is simply no longer excluded from the queue, so the next time someone runs `process` (no
scheduler or background retry -- that still requires a person or script to invoke it) it's attempted
like any other lead, with no special unblocking step first. For the cases that
should still require a person (a genuine business escalation), added `cli retry <leadId>` -- a
human action, audited like approve/reject, that simply writes a new audit row so the lead falls out
of the park automatically (parking is derived purely from "what's the most recent audit_log row,"
so any newer row un-parks it without special-casing).

For the efficiency half of the ask: added a fail-fast path to the retry/backoff logic --
`createCompletionWithRetry` now reads the `retry-after` value off a 429's response headers, and if
it's longer than 30 seconds (a daily-quota-scale wait, not a brief per-minute one), skips all
retries and escalates immediately rather than burning 3+ more doomed requests against an already-
exhausted quota. Also added explicit prompt guidance (`prompts.ts`) encouraging the model to batch
independent read-only tool calls (get_lead_context, check_contact_eligibility,
find_matching_properties, get_property_market_data) into a single turn rather than one at a time,
since each turn is a full request against the rate limit regardless of how many tool calls it
contains. Verified all of this with new deterministic tests (`escalation.test.ts`, plus two new
cases in `retry.test.ts` for the fail-fast/still-retries-short-waits behavior), then confirmed live
against the actual parked lead from the session: `cli retry 1` un-parked it, `cli process 1` hit the
same still-exhausted daily quota but failed fast (~2.5s, consistent with one rejected request and no
wasted retries) and correctly did not re-park the lead this time.

## Entry 14 — Dashboard indicator was misleading, twice

Asked to explain why the dashboard still showed a lead's stage as `new` and "Escalated: no" right
after `cli process` had just printed `escalated`. Both were correct but the second one exposed a
real bug: the initial "Escalated" column collapsed "nothing has happened" and "the last run just
failed on a rate limit but isn't blocked" into the same `no`, which read as "nothing happened" right
after the user watched it escalate. Fixed by replacing the boolean with a three-state
`getEscalationStatus` ("none" / "transient" / "parked") so the dashboard can say `rate-limited,
retrying` distinctly from a lead that was never touched.

That label was then challenged directly: "is it really trying?" It wasn't -- "retrying" implied an
ongoing background process, but nothing runs on a schedule or daemon; the fail-fast logic from Entry
13 means zero retries happened within that failed call, and nothing will attempt the lead again
until a person (or script) explicitly runs `cli process` a second time. Relabeled to `rate-limited --
rerun process` and corrected the same overclaim ("retried automatically") everywhere it appeared --
README, this file, and the code comments in `queries.ts` -- to say plainly that the lead is merely
*not excluded* from the queue, not that anything is actively retrying it. Worth remembering as a
pattern: "automatically" and "self-heals" are easy words to reach for when describing a passive
"not blocked" state, and both overclaim unless something genuinely runs without being invoked.

## Entry 15 — do_not_contact priority ordering, and a real dead-code bug found while checking it

Asked whether processing the do-not-contact lead (Bob) actually said so, and whether that hard rule
should be checked "first." Investigation showed the specific escalation in question was, again, the
rate-limit safety net (`system_triggered: true`, LLM call failed before the model ever saw the
lead) -- not a real do_not_contact decision at all, so there was nothing to fix in that particular
run. But the underlying design question was worth answering properly: should do_not_contact be
checked in code before the model is even invoked? Decided against a code-level bypass -- eval
scenario 2 and the take-home's #1 priority both specifically test that *the agent* recognizes
do_not_contact and escalates; skipping the model entirely would replace exactly the thing being
graded with a hardcoded guard clause. Instead tightened the prompt (`prompts.ts`) to make
do_not_contact the model's explicit first priority right after get_lead_context, above inspecting
proposals or calling any other tool -- keeps the model genuinely deciding, just efficiently.

Checking prompts.ts surfaced something more serious: `buildSystemPrompt()` took no arguments and
never referenced segment at all. The `segmentGuidance`/`leadContextHint` functions that were
supposed to shape drafting tone per segment (documented in the README as a core design decision
since early in the build) were dead code -- defined, never called from loop.ts. The correct-looking
upgrade-pitch behavior observed earlier for the client-segment lead was the model inferring it from
raw `get_lead_context`/`find_matching_properties` data, not from any actual prompt instruction.
Fixed by folding both segment branches into the static system prompt as conditional guidance the
model resolves once it sees `segment` in get_lead_context's real output, rather than passing segment
into buildSystemPrompt ahead of time (which would mean telling the model a lead-specific fact before
it audits it via the tool call -- the same principle just applied to do_not_contact). Removed the
now-unused `leadContextHint`/`segmentGuidance` functions rather than leaving them as unreferenced
cruft. A reminder that a documented design decision and the actual code are two different claims --
worth spot-checking that a described behavior is still wired in, not just described.

## Entry 16 — cli escalated command, then a definition mismatch with dashboard

Asked for a command to see escalated leads. Added `cli escalated`, scoped to only "parked" leads
(the ones `retry` acts on), reasoning that's what's actionable. Immediately reported back as
inconsistent: `dashboard` showed 2 leads with something in its `Escalated` column, but `cli
escalated` said none. Verified directly rather than assuming -- both of those leads were
`transient` (rate-limit) status, correctly excluded by the "parked only" filter. So the
classification logic wasn't wrong, but the *naming* was: a column literally titled "Escalated"
showing a lead, and a command literally named `escalated` not showing that same lead, is a
real inconsistency regardless of whether each piece is individually "correct." Fixed by widening
`cli escalated` to the same predicate as the dashboard column (`status !== "none"`), adding a
`Status` column so `parked` and `transient` are still visually distinct within the list. Two
commands sharing a name should share a definition, even when the narrower one seemed more useful
in isolation.

## Entry 17 — Request-count optimization + real quota reporting

Asked to optimize request usage directly (not just handle failures gracefully) and to surface
remaining quota after each run, after repeatedly hitting the 50/day cap during testing. Traced
where requests actually go: each assistant *turn* is one request regardless of how many tool calls
it contains, and a typical happy-path run was taking ~5 turns (get_lead_context alone, then
check_contact_eligibility + find_matching_properties together, then get_property_market_data, then
log_note, then propose_message) -- most of that sequential separation wasn't necessary.

Rewrote the prompt's priority ordering (`prompts.ts`) around this: get_lead_context,
check_contact_eligibility, and find_matching_properties all only need the lead_id already known
from the instruction and don't depend on each other, so the model is now told to request all three
in its very first turn, always, since it costs the same one request whether it asks for one tool or
three. get_property_market_data still can't move earlier (it genuinely needs find_matching_properties's
property_id first), but the prompt now tells the model it can combine that call with the terminal
propose_message/propose_viewing in the same later turn -- with an explicit note that call order
within a turn matters, since propose_message's numeric-grounding check only sees a
get_property_market_data result that already ran. Also de-emphasized log_note, which was previously
"use liberally": it costs a full turn like anything else, so it's now scoped to genuinely non-obvious
reasoning (e.g. right before an ambiguous escalation) rather than a routine step. Net effect: a
typical propose-only run should drop from ~5 turns to ~3.

For visibility: added RateLimitInfo, capturing OpenAI's real x-ratelimit-* response headers via the
SDK's .withResponse() (works on both success and thrown-error paths, confirmed by reading the SDK's
own type definitions rather than guessing at the API surface) into RunResult.rateLimitInfo. cli
process and the standalone runQueue.ts script print "X/Y requests remaining" after every lead --
real numbers from the API itself, not an estimate.

This surfaced a real test-hygiene issue: every stub OpenAI client across the test suite mimicked the
old direct-await shape (`create()` returning a plain Promise), but the production code now always
calls `.create(params).withResponse()` -- a chainable method that a bare Promise doesn't have. The
retry tests kept "passing" anyway, for the wrong reason: calling `.withResponse` on a plain Promise
throws a TypeError that happens to look enough like a non-retryable error to still produce
"escalated" outcomes, masking that the stubs weren't exercising the real code path at all. Only the
progress test's assertion on exact turn/token counts was strict enough to actually fail and expose
it. Fixed all three affected stub clients (retry.test.ts, progress.test.ts, escalation.test.ts) to
implement the real `.withResponse()` chain, and added two new tests asserting rateLimitInfo is
captured correctly from both a successful and a failed call. Lesson: a test "passing" isn't the same
as a test exercising the path it claims to -- worth periodically checking that a mocked dependency's
shape hasn't drifted from what production code actually calls.

## Entry 18 — Capping requests per pass, not just per run

Asked two follow-ups after Entry 17: is there more to squeeze out of per-lead request count, and
can the *number of leads touched per invocation* be capped so a casual `cli process` or `npm run
evals` doesn't accidentally drain a whole day's quota.

On the first: the per-run turn count (2-3, see Entry 17) is already close to the theoretical floor.
Any tool call that depends on another tool's result (do_not_contact's escalate-or-not branch,
propose_message needing get_property_market_data's grounded figures) can't be requested in the same
turn as the call it depends on, since every tool call within one turn is issued from a single model
decision before any of that turn's results come back -- there's no way to conditionally branch
within a turn. So 2 turns (gather state, then act on it) is the floor for any lead needing a
state-dependent decision, and main is already there for most cases; only the "property matched and
needs market data" path can slip to 3 if the model doesn't take the prompt up on combining
get_property_market_data with the terminal propose call.

On the second, which was the more actionable one: `cli process` (no leadId) and `npm run evals` had
no way to bound how much of the daily budget a single invocation could consume. `cli process` drains
the *entire* queue (up to all 8 seeded leads, ~16-24 requests in one call) with no way to stop
partway through short of Ctrl+C. Added an optional `limit` param to `processQueue`
(`src/agent/runQueue.ts`) -- appended as a trailing optional argument rather than reordering existing
positional params, so none of the three existing call sites needed to change -- applied only to the
fresh-lead queue, not a resumed in-progress lead (that one was already committed to before this call
started). Wired up as `cli process --limit <n>`. Added a regression test
(`locking.test.ts`) seeding 3 leads with limit=2 and asserting the 3rd is left untouched.

`npm run evals` runs 9 total `runAgentForLead` calls across its 7 scenarios (scenario 1: 2, scenario
3: 3, the rest: 0-1 each) -- roughly 20-25 requests for a full run, which alone can eat half a
50-request daily cap. Added `--quick`, an opt-in flag (default behavior unchanged, so the full suite
still runs when it matters for grading) that filters to scenarios 1, 2, 5, and 6: one complete
propose->approve->send cycle plus one scenario from each distinct guardrail category (hard
prohibition, state-machine transition, evidence-gated reactivation) -- 4 runs instead of 9, skipping
scenario 3 (rejection/revise, which re-exercises the same propose path scenario 1 already covers,
just twice more) and scenarios 4/7 (additional escalation/grounding variants of coverage scenario 2
and 1 already provide, not new guardrail categories).

## Entry 19 — Final live verification with a working key

Getting a genuinely usable key took two dead ends first, both real and worth recording since they
looked like code bugs before they weren't. First attempt hit `429` with "Rate limit reached... on
tokens per min (TPM): Limit 100000, Used 100000" and an ~11-hour retry-after -- not the 50-req/day
limit this session's optimization work targeted, but a separate token-based cap, tied to the
*organization*, not the individual key. A second key generated under what was assumed to be a fresh
account hit a different error immediately -- `429 You exceeded your current quota, please check your
plan and billing details` (OpenAI's `insufficient_quota`) -- which turned out to mean the account
itself had $0 balance and no payment method, since OpenAI no longer grants free trial credits to most
new signups. Neither was a code problem: both times the system did exactly what it's supposed to --
retried within budget, then escalated gracefully with the real provider error message intact
(`system_triggered: true`, classified `transient` not `parked`, so no manual `retry` was needed once
a working key was in place).

Manual spot-checks against a properly billed key confirmed several things live rather than just in
stubbed tests: the do-not-contact hard guardrail escalating correctly (Bob) while still batching its
three context reads into turn 1 as designed (confirmed via `history`'s timestamps -- three calls in
the same second, `escalate_to_agent` two seconds later); the numeric-grounding guardrail rejecting a
real first draft that mentioned a shorthand price before market data had been fetched, then accepting
the corrected second draft (Alice); and the rejection-feedback loop producing a materially different
second proposal, not a cosmetic reword -- switched from `propose_viewing` to `propose_message`
entirely, softer tone, real grounded figures (Grace).

With that confidence, ran the actual graded suite: `npm run evals`, full 7 scenarios, no `--quick`.
All 7 passed against the live model on the first clean attempt. This is the deliverable the eval
requirement asks for -- scripted scenarios asserting real final DB state against a real LLM, not
mocked responses -- and it passed end to end.

## Entry 20 — `cli quota`: checking the budget without spending it on a lead

Quota was only ever visible as a side effect of `cli process` -- which also runs real business logic
(tool calls, DB writes) against whichever lead it touches. Added a standalone `quota` command that
spends the minimum possible on purpose: one completion call, no tools, purely to read the real
`x-ratelimit-*` response headers via the same `extractRateLimitInfo` used everywhere else (exported
from `loop.ts` along with `getClient`/`DEFAULT_MODEL` rather than duplicated).

Two real API quirks surfaced immediately by actually running it against a live key, not by reasoning
about it in the abstract:
1. First attempt used `max_tokens: 1` and got a `400`: `Unsupported parameter: 'max_tokens' is not
   supported with this model. Use 'max_completion_tokens' instead.` -- worth noting the error path
   still correctly recovered and printed the real quota numbers (25/50 remaining) even though the
   call itself failed, which is exactly the fallback this command needed but hadn't been tested yet.
2. Switched to `max_completion_tokens: 1` and hit a second `400`: `Could not finish the message
   because max_tokens or model output limit was reached.` -- this model reserves part of its
   completion-token budget for internal reasoning before any visible output, so `1` wasn't enough
   even for a trivial reply. Bumped to `64` and it succeeded cleanly.

Both fixes cost a real request each to discover -- an acceptable, small trade for shipping a command
whose entire purpose is telling the truth about quota, verified rather than assumed to work.

## Entry 21 — Quota reporting was only telling half the truth

Live evidence surfaced this directly: `cli quota` reported "22/50 requests remaining," then the very
next `cli process` call escalated with a 429 whose message read "tokens per min (TPM): Limit 100000,
Used 99556" -- a completely healthy request count next to an almost-exhausted token bucket. These
looked contradictory but aren't: OpenAI enforces requests/day and tokens/minute as two independent
buckets, and a call only succeeds if it clears both. `extractRateLimitInfo` (`src/agent/loop.ts`) was
only ever reading the `x-ratelimit-*-requests` headers, never `x-ratelimit-*-tokens` -- so every
quota line this system had printed all session was giving a technically-true but incomplete picture,
one that read as reassuring right up until the moment a request failed for a reason it couldn't see
coming.

Fixed by extending `RateLimitInfo` with `limitTokens`/`remainingTokens`/`resetTokens`, extracted
alongside the existing requests fields in the same function, and printed as a second, independent
line everywhere the first one was already showing (`cli process`, `cli quota`, `runQueue.ts`) -- each
flagged red on its own threshold (absolute <=5 for requests, since limits vary less there; relative
<=5% for tokens, since limits scale by orders of magnitude across tiers). Added a regression test
reproducing the exact live scenario (22/50 requests, 444/100000 tokens) to make sure a healthy request
count can never again quietly stand in for the whole picture. Verified against the live key
afterward: `cli quota` now prints both lines, and the token one was the one actually near zero.

## Entry 22 — Per-turn token overhead: measured, considered, deliberately not pursued

Once tokens/minute (not requests/day) turned out to be the real live blocker, the natural next
question was whether the per-turn overhead itself could shrink. Measured it directly rather than
guessing: `buildSystemPrompt()` is ~1507 tokens, the 10 tool JSON schemas (`OPENAI_TOOLS`) are
~1090 tokens, ~2597 combined -- and that full payload gets resent on *every* turn, since chat
completions calls are stateless, so a 2-3 turn run needs 5000-7800+ tokens of overhead alone before
counting the growing conversation history.

Decided not to trim it, for two reasons. First, it wouldn't have fixed the actual problem in front of
us: even an aggressive cut couldn't plausibly get a turn's requirement under the ~445 tokens actually
remaining -- only the real TPM reset (or a different billing tier) unblocks that. Second, and more
generally, the prompt and tool descriptions aren't padding -- they're carrying the stage-graph
explanation, the guardrail priority ordering, and the turn-batching instructions that got the
*request* count down in Entry 17. Shrinking that text to save tokens risks the model needing *more*
turns to reach the same correct decision, which could quietly undo that earlier win in the metric
that actually matters (requests/day, the harder daily cap) while chasing a softer one (tokens/min,
which regenerates continuously). Recorded here as a reasoned pass, not an oversight: this is a real
lever for a production system at real volume, and out of scope for what this submission needs.

## Entry 23 — Consolidating every limit into one config file

Asked directly: were the guardrail limits (contact cap, reactivation window) collected in one place,
and could the system be organized the way an org actually would -- one file where every tunable
threshold lives, not scattered across whichever module happens to enforce it. Audited the whole
codebase for `const NAME = value`-shaped constants first rather than assuming: the guardrail limits
were already together in `src/domain/stateMachine.ts` (`CONTACT_WINDOW_DAYS`, `MAX_SENDS_IN_WINDOW`,
`MAX_UNANSWERED_ATTEMPTS`, `REACTIVATION_EVIDENCE_MAX_AGE_DAYS`, `REACTIVATION_EVIDENCE_TYPES`), but
the operational tuning knobs were not -- `MAX_ASSISTANT_TURNS`, retry count/backoff, the
worthwhile-retry-after threshold, and the cost-per-token estimate all lived inside `loop.ts`, and the
lock timeout lived inside `queries.ts`.

Created `src/config/limits.ts` as the single source of truth for both categories, grouped by what
governs which behavior with a comment on *why* each value, not just what it's called. Moved
(not duplicated) every constant there: `stateMachine.ts` now imports `MAX_UNANSWERED_ATTEMPTS` for
its own internal use; the three tool files that previously pulled `CONTACT_WINDOW_DAYS` /
`MAX_SENDS_IN_WINDOW` / `REACTIVATION_EVIDENCE_*` off `stateMachine.ts` now import them directly from
`config/limits.ts` instead (while still importing the actual guardrail *functions* --
`canReactivateFrom`, `nextStageAfterMessageSend`, etc. -- from `stateMachine.ts`, since those stay
where they're enforced); `loop.ts` imports its five operational constants and re-exports
`DEFAULT_MODEL` so `cli/index.ts`'s existing import didn't need to change; `queries.ts` imports
`LOCK_TIMEOUT_MS`. Verified nothing was left duplicated with a repo-wide grep for each constant name
outside the new file. `tsc --noEmit` clean, 26/26 unit tests still pass unchanged -- this was a pure
reorganization, no behavior changed anywhere.

## Entry 24 — A pre-submission self-review pass

Asked directly whether this reflected everything a senior engineer would check, not just whether it
met the brief's checklist. Rather than answering that in the abstract, checked concretely and found
two real gaps.

**Invalid CLI input was silently swallowed rather than rejected.** Every command parsing a numeric
id used a bare `Number(arg)` with no validation -- `history abc` printed the harmless-but-meaningless
"No lead with id NaN," but `cli process abc` printed **"Queue is empty -- nothing to process"**,
which is actively misleading: the queue wasn't empty, a typo silently became a no-op that looks like
a legitimate empty state. Root cause: `NaN` flowed unchecked into `getLead`/`getQueue`'s filter,
where `NaN !== NaN` for any comparison, so a bad id just produced empty results indistinguishable
from a genuinely empty queue. Fixed with one shared `parsePositiveInt(raw, label)` helper
(`src/cli/index.ts`) used across all six numeric-arg sites (`history`, `approve`, `reject`,
`process` id and `--limit`, `close`, `retry`) -- fails loud with `Invalid <label>: '<raw>'` instead
of silently propagating. Verified live against `history abc`, `process abc`, and
`process --limit xyz` before and after.

**Prompt injection via untrusted lead-submitted text was never considered or documented.**
`get_lead_context` feeds `interactions.detail`/`contact` -- real third-party content -- straight
into the model's context, and nothing filters it. Didn't add a prompt-level defense (there isn't a
reliable one), but named the actual mitigation explicitly in the README: every consequential action
is gated by code the model can't argue its way past regardless of what an injected instruction told
it to do, so an injection can change what the model *tries*, not what the tools *allow*. Flagged
honestly as "the existing guardrails happen to cover this by design," not "this was specifically
stress-tested" -- it wasn't, and claiming otherwise would be dishonest.

Skipped, by choice, not oversight: a CI pipeline (GitHub Actions running `test`/`typecheck` on
push). Genuinely optional for a take-home submission being reviewed by cloning the repo directly,
and adding it now would be scope for its own sake rather than fixing something broken.

`tsc --noEmit` clean, 26/26 unit tests pass unchanged (this touched CLI presentation logic and docs
only, no domain/tool/loop behavior).
